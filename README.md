mmutils
----

A set of functions I commonly use in my scripts. This library is meant mostly for myself, but if you want to use it, you can install it using pip by running
```
pip install git+https://github.com/mmojsak/mmutils
```
to install the ``mmutils`` module and an executable of the same name into the currently preferred Python package installation directories.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository manually and run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all the requirements.

The code should be run from the command line, but can also be used as a library (all functions are defined in the ``mmutils.py`` module). This package has no documentation.

REQUIREMENTS:
numpy, pickle
